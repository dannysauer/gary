Code Name Gary

## Goals
 * Create a container orchestrator
 * control-plane vs worker node == no difference for install/user.
 * single binary install
 * based on promise theory
 * HA on as few as 3 nodes and scale to millions of nodes 


## Non-goals
 * Service mesh
 * Other things 

## Project pre-alpha road map 
 [*] Initial Cluster API
 [*] Node to node cluster communication interface
 [*] Node to node cluster communication implementation (zeroMQ)
 [ ] Container Runtime integration
 [ ] Machine taints

## Building and testing
Building and local unit testing are made simple by cargo
#### Building
    `cargo build`
use the `--release` flag for a more optimized build. it will take longer to compile.

#### Testing
    `cargo check && cargo fmt -- --check && cargo clippy`

It could be required for you to use `rustup component add clippy && rustup component add fmt` to use those commands.

currently there are a few failures in check and clippy, in the future both of these will be required 
to pass to all of these to be merged.

## Architecture

Based off promise Theory. designed to be control-plane-less. All nodes created equal. [info](docs/architecture.md)
